<h1>CODE RUNNER</h1>

<p>Version: 2.0 beta April 2014</p>

<p>Author: Richard Lobb, University of Canterbury, New Zealand.</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>CodeRunner is a Moodle question type that requests students to submit program code
to some given specification, e.g. a Python function sqr(x) that returns its
parameter squared. The submission is graded by running a series of testcases
of the code in a sandbox, comparing the output with the expected output.
CodeRunner is intended to be run in an adaptive mode, so that students know
immediately if their code is passing the tests. In the typical
'all-or-nothing' mode, all test cases must pass
if the submission is to be awarded any marks. The mark for a set of questions
in a quiz is then determined primarily by which questions the student is able
to  solve successfully and then secondarily by how many submissions the student
makes on each question. However, it is also possible to run CodeRunner questions
in a traditional quiz mode where the mark is determined by how many of the test
cases the code successfully passes.</p>

<p>CodeRunner and its predecessors <em>pycode</em> and <em>ccode</em> has been in use at the
University of Canterbury for about four years, running tens of thousands of
student quiz submissions in Python, C and Matlab. All laboratory
and assignment work in the
introductory first year Python programming course, which has around 400 students
in the first semester and 200 in the second, is assessed using CodeRunner
questions. The mid-semester test also uses Moodle/CodeRunner and it is intended to
run the final examination on Moodle/Coderunner in the near future.
The second year C course of around 200 students makes similar use of Coderunner
using C questions and a third year Civil Engineering course, taught in Matlab,
also uses Coderunner for all labs and for the mid-semester programming exam.</p>

<p>The system currently supports Python2 (considered obsolescent), Python3,
C, Octave and Matlab. Java support
is also present but has not yet been used in courses. The architecture allows
easy extension to other languages and one lecturer has made
intermittent use of <em>clojure</em> questions.</p>

<p>For security and load reasons, it is recommended that CodeRunner be set up
on a special quiz-server rather than on an institution-wide Moodle server.
However, this latest version of CodeRunner does allow use of a remote
sandbox machine for running all student-submitted code so provided only
that sandbox is enabled, as discussed below, this version should actually
be safe to install
on an institutional server.</p>

<p>A single 4-core server can handle an average quiz question submission rate of
about 30 quiz questions per minute while maintaining a response time of less
than about 3 - 4 seconds, assuming the student code itself runs in a
fraction of a second.</p>

<p>Administrator privileges and some Unix skills are needed to install Coderunner.</p>

<h2>Upgrading from an earlier version</h2>

<p>CodeRunner version 2 is a major upgrade from version 1, with many new features
and significant restructuring of the database tables. Although the new
version attempts to update all the database tables to the new format the
update process has been tested on only one system. Some problems occurred and the
upgrade code was edited to deal with those problems but the edits have received
minimal testing because of the absence of any "pure" version 1 system on which to 
test them. If you are currently
running version 1 and wish to upgrade to version 2, it is strongly recommended
that:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>You do not attempt such an upgrade during term time.</p></li>
<li><p>You make a complete backup of your existing server's database before attempting the
upgrade. </p></li>
<li><p>You export all your coderunner questions from the question
database in Moodle XML format.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Also, please feel free to contact the developer (richard.lobb@canterbury.ac.nz)
either to discuss your upgrade beforehand or afterwards if any problems occur.</p>

<p>With all those caveats, upgrading from an earlier version should be as simple
as a raw installation; the upgrade.php script should modify all the database
tables and preserve all existing questions and student submissions. Move the
existing <moodleHome>/local/CodeRunner folder to a backup location, then just
follow the instructions in the next section.</p>

<h3>Installing CodeRunner from scratch</h3>

<p>If you are intending to use the Jobe sandbox, which runs student code on a
remote server, you should first install the PEAR HTTP_Request2 library with
the command</p>

<pre><code>pear install HTTP_Request2
</code></pre>

<p>This assumes pear is already installed. If not, install it first with a
command like (depending on your system)</p>

<pre><code>sudo apt-get install pear
</code></pre>

<p>or</p>

<pre><code>yum install pear
</code></pre>

<p>CodeRunner should then be installed in the <code>&lt;moodlehome&gt;/local</code> directory as follows.</p>

<pre><code>cd &lt;moodlehome&gt;/local
git clone https://github.com/trampgeek/CodeRunner.git
cd CodeRunner
sudo ./install
</code></pre>

<p>The install script sets up symbolic links from the <code>question/type</code> and
<code>question/behaviour</code> directories to corresponding CodeRunner directories; you
must have configured the webserver to follow symbolic links for this to work.</p>

<p>If you wish to use the RunguardSandbox (see below), you will also need to
compile the <em>runguard</em> program and add a new user called <em>coderunner</em> to the 
system. Do not proceed until you have read the various security warnings
in the section <em>The Runguard Sandbox</em> below. If you still wish to install
RunGuard, type the command</p>

<pre><code>sudo ./install_runguard
</code></pre>

<p>This will build <em>runguard</em> and add the user <em>coderunner</em>.  The install script
may prompt for details like the office and phone
number of the coderunner user -- just hit enter to accept the defaults.
The switch to the coderunner user and the controlled execution of the
submitted program in <em>RunguardSandbox</em> is done by a program <code>runguard</code>, written
by Jaap Eldering as part of
the programming contest server <a href="http://domjudge.sourceforge.net/">DOMJudge</a>. This
program needs to be 'setuid root', and hence the install script requires
root permissions to set this up.</p>

<p>All going well, you should finish up with a user 'coderunner'
and a program <em>runguard</em> in CodeRunner/coderunner/Sandbox/ with
setuid-root capabilities. <em>runguard</em> should owned by root with the webserver
user as its group.
This program should not be accessible to users other than root and the web
server.</p>

<h3>Sandbox Configuration</h3>

<p>You next need to decide what particular sandbox or sandboxes you wish to use
for running the student-submitted jobs. You can configure which sandboxes you wish to use
together with the various sandbox parameters via the Moodle administrator settings for the
CodeRunner plugin, accessed via</p>

<pre><code>*Site administration &gt; Plugins &gt; Question types &gt; CodeRunner*.
</code></pre>

<p>Available sandboxes are as follows;</p>

<h4>The JobeSandbox.</h4>

<p>This is the only sandbox enabled by default. It fully
isolates student code from the Moodle server, but does require
the installation of a separate server. Follow the instructions at 
https://github.com/trampgeek/jobe to build a Jobe server, then use the
Moodle administrator interface to define the Jobe
host name and perhaps port number. If your Jobe
server requires an authentication key (not yet implemented in the current
version of the Jobe server) you will need to specify that, too.</p>

<h4>The Liu sandbox</h4>

<p>If you wish to run only C or C++ jobs and wish to avoid the complication of setting
up and maintaining a separate Jobe server, you might wish to consider the
Liu sandbox, which can be installed on the Moodle server itself. It runs all
code with <em>ptrace</em>, and disallows any system call that might allow escape
from the sandbox, including most file i/o. The job to be run is compiled and
built as a static load module before being passed to the sandbox. While the
possibility of an exploit can never be absolutely disregarded, the Liu
sandbox does offer a high level of protection. </p>

<p>The Liu sandbox can be obtained
from <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/libsandbox/">here</a>.  Both the binary and the
Python2 interface need to be installed. Note that CodeRunner does not
currently work with the Python3 interface to the sandbox.</p>

<p>The easiest way to install the Liu sandbox is by
downloading appropriate <code>.deb</code>s or <code>.rpm</code>s of both <code>libsandbox</code> and <code>pysandbox</code> (for
Python version 2). Note that the <code>pysandbox</code> download must be the one appropriate
to the installed  version of Python2 (currently typically 2.6 on RHEL systems
or 2.7 on most other flavours of Linux).</p>

<p>The Liu sandbox requires that C programs be compiled and built using static
version of the libraries rather than the usual dynamically-loaded libraries.
Many versions of the C development packages no longer include static libraries
by default, so you may need to download these separately. Before trying to
use the Liu sandbox, check you can
build a statically linked executable with a command like</p>

<pre><code>    gcc -Wall -Werror -std=c99 -static src.c -lm
</code></pre>

<p>It is also possible to configure the Liu sandbox to run other languages,
but it must be configured to allow any extra system calls required by those
languages and also to access those parts of the file system that the language
expects to access. These are many and varied so this approach is not 
recommended.</p>

<h4>The RunguardSandbox.</h4>

<p>The RunguardSandbox is by far the easiest one to use, as it requires no
extra resources apart from whatever languages (Python3, Java etc) you wish
to use in CodeRunner questions. However, the RunguardSandbox also the least
secure. It runs student submitted jobs on the Moodle server itself, so most
certainly should not be used on an institutional Moodle server, but it
is reasonably
safe if a special-purpose quiz server is being used, assuming that server requires
student login. Our own quiz server at the
University of Canterbury 
made extensive use of the RunguardSandbox for two years with no known security
failures and only one minor resource-depletion problem that has now been
prevented in the code. You should be aware that it does not
prevent use of system calls like <em>socket</em> that might open connections to
other servers behind your firewall and of course it depends on the Unix
server being securely set up in the first place.</p>

<p>The RunguardSandbox uses a program <code>runguard</code>, written
by Jaap Eldering as part of
the programming contest server <a href="http://domjudge.sourceforge.net/">DOMJudge</a>.
This program enforces various resource limitations, such as on CPU time and
memory use, on the student program. It runs the code as the non-privileged
user <em>coderunner</em> so student-submitted code can do even less than a student
with a Linux account can do (as they can't create files outside the /tmp
directory and have severe restrictions on cpu time, threads and memory use).</p>

<h4>The IdeoneSandbox.</h4>

<p>ideone.com is a compute server that runs
programs submitted either through a browser or through a web-services API in
a huge number of different languages. It is not recommended for production
use, as execution turn-around time is frequently too large (from 10 seconds
to a minute or more) to give a tolerable user experience. An
<a href="http://ideone.com/account/register">Ideone account</a>
(username and password) is required to access
the Ideone web-services. Runs are free up to a certain number
but you then have to pay for usage.
The IdeoneSandbox is there mainly as a proof of concept of the idea of off-line
execution and to support occasional use of unusual languages. As with
the other sandboxes, you can configure
the username and password for use of the IdeoneSandbox via the administrator
settings panel for CodeRunner.</p>

<h3>Checking security</h3>

<p>The default Moodle install has all files in the <moodlehome> tree world-readable.
This is BAD, especially if you're running code in the Runguard sandbox,
because the all-important config.php, which contains the database password,
can be read by student code. So it's most important that you at very least
ensure that that particular file is not world-readable.</p>

<p>A better fix is to set the group of the entire Moodle subtree to apache
(or www-data depending on what user the web server runs as) and then make it
all not world readable. However, if you do that after installing CodeRunner
you'll break the set-uid-root program that's used to start the Runguard sandbox.
So you then need to re-run the CodeRunner installer to fix it.</p>

<h3>Running the unit tests</h3>

<p>If your Moodle installation includes the
<em>phpunit</em> system for testing Moodle modules, you might wish to test the
CodeRunner installation. Most tests require that at least python2 and python3
are installed. </p>

<p>You should then be able to run the tests with</p>

<pre><code>    cd &lt;moodlehome&gt;
    sudo php admin/tool/phpunit/cli/init.php
    sudo ./phpunit --testsuite="qtype_coderunner test suite"
</code></pre>

<p>You will almost certainly get a number of errors relating to the various
sandboxes and languages that you have not installed, e.g. the LiuSandbox,
Matlab, Octave and Java. These can all be ignored unless you plan to use
those capabilities. The name of the failing tests should be sufficient to
tell you if you need be at all worried.</p>

<p>Please <a href="mailto:richard.lobb@canterbury.ac.nz">email me</a> if you have problems
with the installation.</p>

<h2>Question types</h2>

<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>CodeRunner support a wide variety of question types and can easily be
extended to support others. A CodeRunner question type is defined by a
<em>question prototype</em>, which specifies run time parameters like the execution
language and sandbox and defines how a test program is built from the
question's test-cases plus the student's submission. The prototype also
defines whether the correctness of the student's submission is assessed by use
of an <em>EqualityGrader</em>, a <em>NearEqualityGrader</em> or <em>RegexGrader</em>. The EqualityGrader expects
the output from the test execution to exactly match the expected output
for the testcase. The NearEqualityGrader is similar but is case insensitive
and tolerates variations in the amount of white space (e.g. missing or extra
blank lines, or multiple spaces where only one was expected).
The RegexGrader expects a regular expression match
instead. The EqualityGrader is recommended for all normal use as it
encourages students to get their output exactly correct; they should be able to
resubmit almost-right answers for a small penalty, which is generally a
better approach than trying to award part marks based on regular expression
matches.</p>

<p>Test cases are defined by the question author to check the student's code.
Each test case defines a fragment of test code, the standard input to be used
when the test program is run and the expected output from that run. The
author can also add additional files to the execution environment.</p>

<p>The test program is constructed from the test case information plus the
student's submission using one of two <em>templates</em> defined by the prototype.
The <em>per-test template</em> defines a different program for each test case.
To achieve higher efficiency with most
question types there is also a <em>combinator template</em> that defines a single
program containing <em>all</em> the different tests. If this template is defined,
and there is no standard input supplied,
CodeRunner
tries to use it first, but falls back to running the separate per-test-case
programs if any runtime exceptions occur. Templates are discussed in more
detail below.</p>

<h3>An example question type</h3>

<p>The C-function question type expects students to submit a C function, plus possible
additional support functions, to some specification. For example, the question
might ask "Write a C function with signature <em>int sqr(int n)</em> that returns
the square of its parameter <em>n</em>". The author will then provide some test
cases of the form</p>

<pre><code>    printf("%d\n", sqr(-11));
</code></pre>

<p>and give the expected output from this test. There is no standard input for
this question type. The per-test template wraps the student's
submission and
the test code into a single program like:</p>

<pre><code>    #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

    // --- Student's answer is inserted here ----

    int main()
    {
        printf("%d\n", sqr(-11));
        return 0;
    }
</code></pre>

<p>which is compiled and run for each test case. The output from the run is
then compared with
the specified expected output (121) and the test case is marked right
or wrong accordingly.</p>

<p>That example ignores the use of the combinator template, which in
the case of the built-in C function question type
builds a program with multiple <em>printf</em> calls interleaved with
printing of a special separator. The resulting output is then split
back into individual test case results using the separator string as a splitter.</p>

<h3>Built-in question types</h3>

<p>The file <moodlehome>/question/type/coderunner/db/questions-CR<em>PROTOTYPES.xml
is an moodle-xml export format file containing the definitions of all the
built-in question types. During install, and at the end of any version upgrade,
the prototype questions from that file are all loaded into a category
CR</em>PROTOTYPES in the system context. A system administrator can edit the
those prototypes but this is not generally recommended as the modified versions
will be lost on each upgrade. Instead, a category LOCAL_PROTOTYPES
(or other such name of your choice) should be created and copies of any prototype
questions that need editing should be stored there, with the question-type
name modified accordingly. New prototype question types can also be created
in that category. Editing of prototypes is discussed later in this
document.</p>

<p>Built-in question types including the following:</p>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>c_function</strong>. This is the question type discussed in the above
example. The student supplies
just a function (plus possible support functions) and each test is (typically) of the form</p>

<pre><code>printf(format_string, func(arg1, arg2, ..))
</code></pre>

<p>The template for this question type generates some standard includes, followed
by the student code followed by a main function that executes the tests one by
one.</p>

<p>The manner in which a C program is executed is not part of the question
type definition: it is defined by the particular sandbox to which the
execution is passed. The Liu Sandbox and the CodeRunner sandbox both use the gcc
compiler with the language set to
accept C99 and with both <em>-Wall</em> and <em>-Werror</em> options set on the command line
to issue all warnings and reject the code if there are any warnings.
The Liu sandbox also requires that the executable be statically linked; you 
may need to download the static libraries separately from the default C
development install to enable this.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>python3</strong>. Used for most Python3 questions. For each test case, the student
code is run first, followed by the test code.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>python3<em>w</em>output</strong>. A variant of the <em>python3</em> question in which the
<em>input</em> function is redefined at the start of the program so that the standard
input characters that it consumes are echoed to standard output as they are
when typed on the keyboard during interactive testing. A slight downside of
this question type compared to the <em>python3</em> type is that the student code
is displaced downwards in the file so that line numbers present in any
syntax or runtime error messages do not match those in the student's original
code.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>python2</strong>. Used for most Python2 questions. As for python3, the student
code is run first, followed by the sequence of tests. This question type
should be considered to be
obsolescent due to the widespread move to Python3 through the education
community.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>java_method</strong>. This is intended for early Java teaching where students are
still learning to write individual methods. The student code is a single method,
plus possible support methods, that is wrapped in a class together with a
static main method containing the supplied tests (which will generally call the
student's method and print the results).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>java_class</strong>. Here the student writes an entire class (or possibly
multiple classes), which (currently) must <em>not</em> be
public. The test cases are then wrapped in the main method for a separate
public test class which is added to the students class and the whole is then
executed. If you wish students to instead submit <em>public</em> classes, you must
change the template to strip the word public from the start of their class
definition using the text-substitution capabilities of the template processor
<a href="http://twig.sensiolabs.org/">Twig</a>. [Students can construct programs
that will not be correctly processed by simplistic substitutions of this
sort, but then they just fail the tests. They soon learn to write their
classes in the expected manner!]</p></li>
<li><p><strong>java_program</strong>. Here the student writes a complete program which is compiled
then executed once for each test case to see if it generates the expected output
for that test.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>octave_function</strong>. This uses the open-source Octave system to process
matlab-like student submissions. It has not yet been used for teaching so
should be regarded as experimental. </p></li>
</ol>

<p>As discussed later, this base set of question types can
be customised or extended in various ways.</p>

<p>C++ isn't available as a built-in type at present, as we don't teach it. 
However, if the Jobe server is configured to run C++ jobs (probably using
the language ID 'cpp') you should be able to make a custom C++ question
type by starting with the C question type, setting the language to <em>cpp</em>
and changing the template to include
<em>iostream</em> instead of, or as well as, <em>stdio.h</em>. The line</p>

<pre><code>    using namespace std;
</code></pre>

<p>may also be desirable.</p>

<h3>Some more-specialised question types</h3>

<p>The following question types used to exist as built-ins but have now been
dropped from the main install as they are intended primarily for University
of Canterbury (UOC) use only. They can be imported, if desired, from the file
<strong>uoclocalprototypes.xml</strong>, located in the CodeRunner/coderunner/db folder.</p>

<p>The UOC question types include:</p>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>python3_pylint_func</strong>. The student submission is prefixed by a dummy module
docstring and the code is pas 1. <strong>octave_function</strong>. This uses the open-source Octave system to process
matlab-like student submissions. It has not yet been used for teaching so
should be regarded as experimental. sed through the <a href="http://www.logilab.org/857">pylint</a>
source code analyser. The submission is rejected if pylint gives any errors,
otherwise testing proceeds as normal. Obviously, pylint needs to be installed
on the Jobe server or the Moodle server itself if the RunguardSandbox is
being used.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>python3_pylint_prog</strong>. This is identical to the previous type except that no
dummy docstring is added at the top as the submission is expected to be a
stand-alone program.python</p></li>
<li><p><strong>c_full_main_tests</strong>. This is a rarely used special question type where
students write global declarations (types, functions etc) and each test is a
complete C main function that uses the student-supplied declarations.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>matlab_function</strong>. This is the only supported matlab question type.
It assumes
matlab is installed on the Jobe or Moodle server and can be run with the shell command
"/usr/local/bin/matlab_exec_cli".
A ".m" test file is built that contains a main test function, which executes
all the supplied test cases, followed by the student code which must be in the
form of one or more function declarations. That .m file is executed by Matlab,
various Matlab-generated noise is filtered, and the output must match that
specified for the test cases.</p></li>
</ol>

<h2>Templates</h2>

<p>Templates are the key to understanding how a submission is tested. There are in
general two templates per question type (i.e. per prototype) - a <em>combinator_template</em> and a
<em>per_test_template</em>. We'll discuss the latter for a start.</p>

<p>The <em>per_test_template</em> for each question type defines how a program is built from the
student's code and one particular testcase. That program is compiled (if necessary)
and run with the standard input defined in that testcase, and the output must
then match the expected output for the testcase (where 'match' is defined
by the chosen validator: an exact match, a nearly exact match or a
regular-expression match.</p>

<p>The question type template is processed by the
<a href="http://twig.sensiolabs.org/">Twig</a> template engine. The engine is given both
the template and a variable called
STUDENT_ANSWER, which is the text that the student entered into the answer box,
plus another called TEST, which is a record containing the test-case
that the question author has specified
for the particular test. The template will typically use just the TEST.testcode
field, which is the "test" field of the testcase, and usually (but not always)
is a bit of code to be run to test the student's answer. As an example,
the question type <em>c_function</em>, which asks students to write a C function,
has the following template:</p>

<pre><code>    #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
    #include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;
    #include &lt;ctype.h&gt;

    {{ STUDENT_ANSWER }}

    int main() {
        {{ TEST.testcode }};
        return 0;
    }
</code></pre>

<p>A typical test (i.e. <code>TEST.testcode</code>) for a question asking students to write a
function that
returns the square of its parameter might be:</p>

<pre><code>    printf("%d\n", sqr(-9))
</code></pre>

<p>with the expected output of 81. The result of substituting both the student
code and the test code into the template would then be a program like:</p>

<pre><code>    #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
    #include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;
    #include &lt;ctype.h&gt;

    int sqr(int n) {
        return n * n;
    }

    int main() {
        printf("%d\n", sqr(-9));
        return 0;
    }
</code></pre>

<p>When authoring a question you can inspect the template for your chosen
question type by temporarily checking the 'Customise' checkbox. Additionally,
if you check the <em>Template debugging</em> checkbox (hidden until you click the
<em>Show more</em> link) you will get to see 
in the output web page each of the
complete programs that gets run during a question submission.</p>

<p>As mentioned earlier, there are actually two templates for each question
type. For efficiency, CodeRunner first tries
to combine all testcases into a single compile-and-execute run using the second
template, called the <code>combinator_template</code>. There is a combinator
template for most
question types, except for questions that require students
to write a whole program. However, the combinator template is not used during
testing if standard input is supplied for any of the tests; each test
is then assumed to be independent of the others, with its own input. Also,
if an exception occurs at runtime when a combinator template is being used,
the tester retries all test cases individually using the per-test-case
template so that the student gets presented with all results up to the point
at which the exception occurred.</p>

<p>As mentioned above, both the <code>per_test_template</code> and the <code>combinator_template</code>
can be edited by the question
author for special needs, e.g. if you wish to provide skeleton code to the
students. As a simple example, if you wanted students to provide the missing
line in a C function that returns the square of its parameter, and you
also wished to hide the <em>printf</em> from the students, you could use
a template like:</p>

<pre><code>    #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
    #include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;
    #include &lt;ctype.h&gt;

    int sqr(int n) {
       {{ STUDENT_ANSWER }}
    }

    int main() {
        printf({{ TEST.testcode }});
        return 0;
    }
</code></pre>

<p>The testcode would then just be of the form <em>sqr(-11)</em>, and the question text
would need to make it clear
to students what context their code appears in. The authoring interface
allows the author to set the size of the student's answer box, and in a
case like the above you'd typically set it to just one or two lines in height
and perhaps 30 columns in width.</p>

<p>When you edit the per-test template, the combinator template is immediately
disabled. You can re-enable and edit it, if you wish, by opening
the <em>Advanced
Customisation</em> block.</p>

<p>You will need to understand loops and selection in
the Twig template engine if you wish to write your own combinator templates.
For one-off question use, the combinator template doesn't normally offer
sufficient additional benefit to warrant the complexity increase
unless you have a
large number of testcases or are using
a slow-to-launch language like Matlab. However, if you are writing your
own question types you might wish to make use of it.</p>

<h2>Advanced template use</h2>

<p>It may not be obvious from the above that the template mechanism allows
for almost any sort of question where the answer can be evaluated by a computer.
In all the examples given so far, the student's code is executed as part of
the test process but in fact there's no need for this to happen. The student's
answer can be treated as data by the template code, which can then execute
various tests on that data to determine its correctness. The Python <em>pylint</em>
question types given earlier are a simple example: the template code first
writes the student's code to a file and runs <em>pylint</em> over that file before
proceeding with any tests. The per-test template for this question type (which must
run in the JobeSandbox or the RunguardSandbox, with pylint installed in
the appropriate server) is:</p>

<pre><code>__student_answer__ = """{{ STUDENT_ANSWER | e('py') }}"""

import subprocess

def check_code(s):
    try:javaEscaper
        source = open('source.py', 'w')
        source.write(s)
        source.close()
        result = subprocess.check_output(['pylint', 'source.py'], stderr=subprocess.STDOUT)
    except Exception as e:
        result = e.output.decode('utf-8')

    if result.strip():
        print("pylint doesn't approve of your program")
        print(result)
        raise Exception("Submission rejected")

check_code(__student_answer__)

{{ STUDENT_ANSWER }}
{{ TEST.testcode }}
</code></pre>

<p>The Twig syntax {{ STUDENT_ANSWER | e('py') }} results in the student's submission
being filtered by a Python escape function that escapes all
all double quote and backslash characters with an added backslash.
Note that in the event of a failure an exception is raised; this ensures that
further testing is aborted so that the student doesn't receive the same error
for every test case. [As noted above, the tester aborts the testing sequence
when using the per-test-case template if an exception occurs.]</p>

<p>Some other more complex examples that we've
used in practice include:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>A Matlab question in which the template code (also Matlab) breaks down
the student's code into functions, checking the length of each to make
sure it's not too long, before proceeding with marking.</p></li>
<li><p>A Python question where the student's code is actually a compiler for
a simple language. The template code runs the student's compiler,
passes its output through an assembler that generates a JVM class file,
then runs that class with the JVM to check its correctness.</p></li>
<li><p>A Python question where the students submission isn't code at all, but
is a textual description of a Finite State Automaton for a given transition
diagram; the template code evaluates the correctness of the supplied
automaton.</p></li>
</ol>

<h3>Twig Escapers</h3>

<p>As explained above, the Twig syntax {{ STUDENT_ANSWER | e('py') }} results
in the student's submission
being filtered by a Python escape function that escapes all
all double quote and backslash characters with an added backslash. The
python escaper e('py') is just one of the available escapers. Others are:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>e('java'). This prefixes single and double quote characters with a backslash
and replaces newlines, returns, formfeeds, backspaces and tabs with their
usual escaped form (\n, \r etc).</p></li>
<li><p>e('c').  This is an alias for e('java').</p></li>
<li><p>e('matlab'). This escapes single quotes, percents and newline characters.
It must be used in the context of sprintf, e.g.</p>

<pre><code>student_answer = sprintf('{{ STUDENT_ANSWER | e('matlab')}}');
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>e('js'), e('html') for use with JavaScript and html respectively. These 
are Twig built-ins. See the Twig documentation for details.</p></li>
</ol>

<h2>Template parameters</h2>

<p>NOTE: this functionality is still experimental and might change.</p>

<p>It is sometimes necessary to make quite small changes to a template over many
different questions. For example, you might want to use the <em>pylint</em> question
type above but change the maximum allowable length of a function in different
questions. Customising the template for each such question has the disadvantage
that your derived questions no longer inherit from the original prototype, so
that if you wish to alter the prototype you will also need to find 
and modify all the
derived questions, too.</p>

<p>In such cases a better approach may be to use template parameters.</p>

<p>If the <em>+Show more</em> link on the Coderunner question type panel in the question
authoring form is clicked, some extra controls appear. One of these is
<em>Template parameters</em>. This can be set to a JSON-encoded record containing
definitions of variables that can be used by the template engine to perform
local per-question customisation of the template.</p>

<p>For example, the <em>pylint</em> template might cater for passing extra parameters
to pylint via a parameter 'pylintoptions', using template code like:</p>

<pre><code>pylint_opts = []
{% for option in QUESTION.parameters.pylintoptions %}
pylint_opts.append('{{option}}')
{% endfor %}
cmd = ['pylint', 'source.py'] + pylint_opts
result = subprocess.check_output(cmd, stderr=subprocess.STDOUT, env=env)
</code></pre>

<p>If a particular pylint question then wishes to set limits on the number of
statements and the number of arguments per function it could set the
template parameters for the question to</p>

<pre><code>{"pylintoptions":['--max-statement=20', '--max-args=3']}
</code></pre>

<h2>Grading with templates</h2>

<p>Using just the template mechanism described above it is possible to write
almost arbitrarily complex questions. Grading of student submissions can,
however, be problematic in some situations. For example, you may need to
ask a question where many different valid program outputs are possible, and the
correctness can only be assessed by a special testing program. Or
you may wish to subject
a student's code to a very large
number of tests and award a mark according to how many of the test cases
it can handle. The usual exact-match
grader cannot handle these situations. For such cases the "template does
grading" checkbox can be used.</p>

<p>When the 'template does grading' checkbox is checked
the output from the run is not passed to the grader but is taken as the
grading result. The output from the template-generated program must now
be a JSON-encoded object (such as a dictionary, in Python) containing
at least a 'fraction' field, which is multiplied by TEST.mark to decide how
many marks the test case is awarded. It should usually also contain a 'got'
field, which is the value displayed in the 'Got' column of the results table.
The other columns of the results table (testcode, stdin, expected) can also
be defined by the custom grader and will be used instead of the values from
the testcase. As an example, if the output of the program is the string</p>

<pre><code>{"fraction":0.5, "got": "Half the answers were right!"}
</code></pre>

<p>half marks would be
given for that particular test case and the 'Got' column would display the
text "Half the answers were right!".</p>

<p>Writing a grading template that executes the student's code is, however,
rather difficult as the generated program needs to be robust against errors
in the submitted code.</p>

<h2>An advanced grading-template example</h2>

<p>As an example of the use of a custom grader, consider the following question:</p>

<p>"What single line of code can be inserted into the underlined blank space
in the code below to make the function behave as specified? Your answer
should be just the missing line of code, not the whole function.
It doesn't matter if you indent your code or not in the answer box.
For full marks your answer must be a single line of code. However,
half marks will be awarded if you provide more than one line of code but it
works correctly.</p>

<pre><code>    def nums_in_range(nums, lo, hi):
        '''Given a non-empty list of numbers nums and two numbers
           lo and hi return True if and only if the minimum of the
           numbers in nums is greater than lo and the maximum of
           the numbers in nums is less than hi.'''
        ____________________________
</code></pre>

<p>The grader for this question, which needs to check both the number of
lines of code submitted and the correctness, awarding marks and appropriate
feedback accordingly, might be the following:</p>

<pre><code>    import re
    __student_answer__ = """{{ STUDENT_ANSWER | e('py') }}"""
    if __student_answer__.strip().startswith('def'):
        raise Exception("You seem to have pasted the whole function " +
                        "definition. READ THE INSTRUCTIONS!")
    if re.search(r'print *\(.*\)', __student_answer__):
        mark = 0
        got = "BAD CODE: your function should not print anything"
    else:
        # Split the code into lines. Indent if necessary.
        __lines__ = __student_answer__.split('\n')
        __lines__ = ['    ' + line +
                '\n' for line in __lines__ if line.strip() != '']
        code = 'def nums_in_range(nums, lo, hi):\n' + ''.join(__lines__)
        exec(code)
        num_lines = len(__lines__)

        result = {{TEST.testcode}}
        if result == {{TEST.expected}}:
            if num_lines &gt; 1:
                mark = 0.5
                got = repr(result) + r"\n(but more than 1 line of code)"
            else:
                mark = 1
                got = repr(result)
        else:
            mark = 0
            if num_lines &gt; 1:
                got = repr(result) + r"\n(and more than one line of code)"
            else:
                got = repr(result)

    print('{"fraction":' + str(mark) + ',"got":"' + got + '"}')
</code></pre>

<p>If the student submits one line of code that behaves correctly
their grading table looks normal, e.g.
<img src="rightAnswerToGraderExample.png" alt="right answer image" title="" /></p>

<p>If they submit multiple lines of code that behave correctly, their result
table might instead be:
<img src="wrongAnswerToGraderExample.png" alt="wrong answer image" title="" /></p>

<p>Note that the "Got" column contains a customised message in addition to
their output and the customised message varies according to whether their
answer was right or wrong. Note too that the template performs various other
checks on their code, such as whether it contains any print statements or
whether they have pasted an entire function definition.</p>

<p>Obviously, writing questions using custom graders is much harder than
using the normal built-in equality based grader. It is often possible to
ask the question in a different way that avoids the need for a custom grader.
In the above example, the
student could have been asked to submit their entire function twice,
once to a question that evaluated its
correctness and a second time to one that evaluated its correctness <em>and</em>
its length. No custom grader is then required. That is
somewhat clumsy from the student perspective
but is much easier for the author.</p>

<h2>User-defined question types</h2>

<p>NOTE: User-defined question types should be regarded as experimental. If
you wish to use them, please read the following very carefully as there are
a few known pitfalls.</p>

<p>As explained earlier, each question type is defined by a prototype question,
which is just
another question in the database from which new questions can inherit. When
customising a question, if you open the <em>Advanced customisation</em> panel you'll
find the option to save your current question as a prototype. You will have
to enter a name for the new question type you're creating. It is strongly
recommended that you also change the name of your question to reflect the
fact that it's a prototype, in order to make it easier to find. The convention
is to start the question name with
the string PROTOTYPE_, followed by the type name. For example,
PROTOTYPE_python3_OOP. Having a
separate category for prototype questions is also recommended. Obviously the
type name you use should be unique, at least within the context of the course
in which the prototype question is being used.</p>

<p>In the current implementation, CodeRunner searches for prototype questions
just in the current course. The search includes parent
contexts, typically visible only to an administrator, such as the system
context; the built-in prototypes all reside in that system context. Thus if
a teacher in one course creates a new question type, it will immediately
appear in the question type list for all authors editing questions within
that course but it will not be visible to authors in other courses. If you wish
to make a new question type available globally you should ask a
Moodle administrator
to move the question to the system context, such as a LOCAL_PROTOTYPES
category, mentioned above.</p>

<p>BUG ALERT: it is currently possible to define a prototype question in a
category generated by Moodle
that is specific to a particular quiz but is not shared in the course context.
The current search algorithm will not find such a prototype so it cannot be
used. Furthermore a
"programmer error" exception will be thrown if you subsequently attempt
to edit that prototype; it must be deleted or moved to a category that's
visible to the entire course. To avoid issues of this sort, you should define
a PROTOTYPES category within your course and place all question prototypes
there.</p>

<p>The above-described scoping of user-defined prototypes is experimental and
might change in the future, e.g. back to a simple global scope in which all
user-defined prototypes are visible everywhere.</p>

<p>When you create a question of a particular type, including user-defined
types, all the so-called "customisable" fields are inherited from the
prototype. This means changes to the prototype will affect all the "children"
questions. However, as soon as you customise a child question you copy all the
prototype fields and lose that inheritance.</p>

<p>To reduce the UI confusion, customisable fields are subdivided into the
basic ones (per-test-template, grader, result-table column selectors etc) and
"advanced"
ones. The latter include the language, sandbox, timeout, memory limit and
the "make this question a prototype" feature. The combinator
template is also considered to be an advanced feature. By default, when you edit
the per-test-template the combinator is disabled; you must explicitly re-enable
it (and edit it) if you need it. The JavaScript alerts that tell you this are a
tad annoying but I'm leaving them in so no one can accuse me of not warning them.</p>

<p>One major warning: if you define your own question type you'd better make sure
when you export your question bank
that you include the prototype, or all of its children will die on being imported
anywhere else! Similarly, if you delete a prototype question that's actually
in use, all the children will break, giving runtime errors. To repeat:
user-defined question types are experimental. Caveat emptor.</p>

<h2>How programming quizzes should work</h2>

<p>Historical notes and a diatribe on the use of Adaptive Mode questions ...</p>

<p>The original pycode was inspired by <a href="http://codingbat.com">CodingBat</a>, a site where
students submit Python or Java code that implements a simple function or
method, e.g. a function that returns twice the square of its parameter plus 1.
The student code is executed with a series of tests cases and results are
displayed immediately after submission in a simple tabular form showing each
test case, expected answer
and actual answer. Rows where the answer computed by the student's code
is correct receive a large green tick; incorrect rows
receive a large red cross. The code is deemed correct only if all tests
are ticked. If code is incorrect, students can simply correct it and resubmit.</p>

<p><em>CodingBat</em> proves extraordinarily effective as a student training site. Even
experienced programmers receive pleasure from the column of green ticks and
all students are highly motivated to fix their code and retry if it fails one or more
tests. Some key attributes of this success, to be incorporated into <em>pycode</em>,
were:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Instant feedback. The student pastes their code into the site, clicks
<em>submit</em>, and almost immediately receives back their results.</p></li>
<li><p>All-or-nothing correctness. If the student's code fails any test, it is
wrong. Essentially (thinking in a quiz context) it earns zero marks. Code
has to pass <em>all</em> tests to be deemed mark-worthy.</p></li>
<li><p>Simplicity. The question statement should be simple. The solution should
also be reasonably simple. The display of results is simple and the student
knows immediately what test cases failed. There are no complex regular-expression
failures for the students to puzzle over nor uncertainties over what the
test data was.</p></li>
<li><p>Rewarding green ticks. As noted above, the colour and display of a correct
results table is highly satisfying and a strong motivation to succeed.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>The first two of these requirements are particularly critical. While they can
be accommodated within Moodle by using an <em>adaptive</em> quiz behaviour
in conjunction with an all-or-nothing marking scheme, they are not
how many people view a Moodle quiz. Quizzes are
commonly marked only after submission of all questions, and there is usually
a perception that part marks will be awarded for "partially correct" answers.
However, awarding marks to a piece of code according to how many test cases
it passes can give almost meaningless results. For example, a function that
always just returns 0, or the empty list or equivalent, will usually pass several
of the tests, but surely it shouldn't be given <em>any</em> marks? Seriously flawed
code, for example a string tokenizing function that works only with alphabetic
data, may get well over half marks if the question-setter was not expecting
such flaws.</p>

<p>Accordingly, a key assumption underlying CodeRunner is that quizzes will always
run in Moodle's adaptive mode, which displays results after each question
is submitted, and allows resubmission for a penalty. The mark obtained in a
programming-style quiz is thus determined by how many of the problems the
student can solve in the given time, and how many submissions the student
needs to make on each question.</p>
