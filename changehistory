    - Fix broken styling of result table with Moodle 2.9 (odd/even row
      colours weren't happening).
    - Improve the error message issued if a prototype fetch fails.
    - Fix bug that caused datafiles to get lost when a question was moved to
      from the special "Default fo quiz" category.

      name exist in different contexts.
